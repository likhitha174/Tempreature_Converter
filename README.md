# Tempreature_ConverteA
Temperature converter helps in the conversion of the measurement units of the temperature recorded in a particular unit.

To convert a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit, we use a formula that is (°C × 1.8) + 32. This means we multiply the temperature in Celsius by 1.8, then add 32 to get the temperature in Fahrenheit.

To convert Fahrenheit to celsius, the formula used is °C = 5/9(°F – 32).
